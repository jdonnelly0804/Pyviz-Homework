## **GeoViews plot by size and color:**
![plot_4](Instructions/Images/Geoview%20plot%20(4).png)
**Question:** Which neighborhood has the highest gross rent, and which has the highest sale price per square foot?

*The neighborhoods with the highet gross rent are the cirlces that are with the darkest blue color, this appears to be westood park. The neighborhood with the highest sale price per square foot is based on the size of the circles- so bigger cirlces indicate higher prices. This appears to be the Union Square District.*

**Question:**  How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco?

*The trend in rental income growth increases and the trend in sales prices generally increases. However, the growth in rental income far outpaces the increase in prices. The growth in rental prices is much faster and larger. This does hold true for all neighborhoods.*

**Question:** What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighborhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?

*I would tell my company that their best bet would be to go to neighborhoods with the darkest circles while simultaneously having the smallest circle size. This would guarantee that they could buy the real estate for a low price per square foot but still charge a high rent comparable to other high rent areas.*
